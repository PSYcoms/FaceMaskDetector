# FaceMaskDetector
This is a machine learning project that is a real time face mask detector using Python, OpenCV, Keras, TF, numpy and matplotlib.



Technical/ Software Requirements :
Tensorflow >=1.15.2
Keras ==2.3.1
Imutils ==0.5.3
Numpy ==1.18.2
opencv-python ==4.2.0.*
Matplotlib ==3.2.1
Scipy ==1.4.1
Windows XP and above

You can install these using the command pip install â€“r requirements.txt


In order to train the model, open cmd in the desired path of your project and use the command
python train_mask_detector.py

This will train your model and give the training loss and accuracy curve


In order to use model in real time camera use the command
python detect_mask_video.py
